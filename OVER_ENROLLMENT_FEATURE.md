# Over-Enrollment Feature Implementation

## Summary

Added a comprehensive over-enrollment feature for gym classes that allows administrators to optionally enroll students beyond class capacity limits, with clear visual indicators when classes are over-enrolled.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`contexts/gym/gym-db.ts`)

- Added `allowOverEnrollment: boolean` field to `MetaSettings` interface
- Updated `getOrInitMeta()` to include migration logic for existing settings (defaults to `false`)
- New setting is persisted in IndexedDB's meta store

### 2. Gym Provider Context (`contexts/gym/gym-provider.tsx`)

- Added `allowOverEnrollment` state variable
- Added `toggleAllowOverEnrollment()` function to toggle the setting
- Setting is loaded from database on initialization
- Setting is exposed through the `GymContextValue` interface

### 3. Classes Component (`components/gym-management/classes/classes.tsx`)

- Updated `enroll()` function to respect `allowOverEnrollment` setting
- When disabled: prevents enrollment when class is at capacity
- When enabled: allows unlimited enrollment beyond capacity
- Passes `allowOverEnrollment` prop to `ManageStudentsDialog`

### 4. Manage Students Dialog (`components/gym-management/classes/class-dialogs.tsx`)

- Added `allowOverEnrollment` optional prop
- Added visual indicators for over-enrolled classes:
  - ⚠️ Warning emoji next to enrollment count
  - Orange/amber color scheme for over-enrolled classes
  - Warning message showing how many students over capacity
  - Progress bar capped at 100% with orange color when over-enrolled
- Updated "Class Full" button logic to respect `allowOverEnrollment` setting

### 5. Class Views (`components/gym-management/classes/class-views.tsx`)

- **GridView**: Added over-enrollment indicators
  - Orange text for enrollment count
  - Warning emoji
  - Orange progress bar
  - "Over-enrolled by X" message
- **ListView**: Added same over-enrollment indicators

  - Orange progress bar when over capacity
  - Warning message with student count

- **TableView**: Inherits capacity status from existing logic

### 6. New Gym Options Panel (`components/gym-management/gym-options-panel.tsx`)

- Created new settings panel component
- Features:
  - Toggle switch for "Allow Over-Enrollment"
  - Descriptive text explaining the feature
  - Organized sections for future settings
  - Uses Switch component with Label for accessibility

### 7. Layout Header Update (`components/gym-management/gym-management-layout.tsx`)

- Added new "Gym Options" button (Sliders icon) in header
- Positioned between Demo badge and Navigation Settings
- Opens popover with `GymOptionsPanel` component
- Maintains consistent styling with other header buttons

## Visual Indicators for Over-Enrollment

When a class is over-enrolled, users will see:

1. **Enrollment Count**:

   - Changes to orange/amber color
   - Shows warning emoji (⚠️)
   - Example: "15 / 12 enrolled ⚠️"

2. **Progress Bar**:

   - Capped at 100% visual width (doesn't overflow)
   - Changes to orange color ([&>div]:bg-orange-500)
   - Still accurately represents capacity

3. **Warning Message**:

   - "Over-enrolled by X student(s)" in orange text
   - Appears below progress bar in both grid and list views
   - In dialog: "⚠️ Class is over-enrolled by X student(s)"

4. **Dialog Header**:
   - Entire capacity section has orange tinted background
   - Border highlight in orange

## User Flow

1. Administrator opens Gym Options panel (Sliders icon in header)
2. Toggles "Allow Over-Enrollment" switch ON
3. Setting is immediately saved to database
4. When managing class enrollments:
   - If setting is OFF: "Enroll" button disabled when class is full
   - If setting is ON: Can continue enrolling students indefinitely
5. Over-enrolled classes show orange warning indicators throughout the UI

## Future Extensibility

The `GymOptionsPanel` component is structured to easily add more settings:

- Placeholder section: "More options coming soon..."
- Ready for additional toggles and configurations
- Follows consistent design pattern

## Accessibility

- All switches have proper `id` and `htmlFor` attributes
- Labels are clickable to toggle switches
- Descriptive text explains each setting
- ARIA labels on all icon buttons
- Keyboard navigation supported

## Database Migration

The implementation includes automatic migration for existing gym databases:

- Existing settings without `allowOverEnrollment` are automatically updated
- Default value is `false` (maintains current behavior)
- Migration happens transparently on first load
